# Blockchain-Based Supply Chain Management System

This project implements a basic Blockchain-Based Supply Chain Management System in Java. The system is designed to provide a secure and transparent way of tracking the flow of goods in a supply chain.

## Overview

The system consists of two main components:
1. **Blockchain**: A chain of blocks, where each block contains information about a transaction or event in the supply chain. Blocks are linked together using cryptographic hashes, ensuring the integrity of the data.
2. **Supply Chain Management**: The application logic responsible for adding new transactions to the blockchain and verifying the integrity of the chain.

## Features

- **Immutable Ledger**: Once a block is added to the blockchain, its contents cannot be altered, providing an immutable record of transactions.
- **Transparency**: All participants in the supply chain have access to the same blockchain, providing transparency and visibility into the movement of goods.
- **Security**: The use of cryptographic hashes ensures that the integrity of the blockchain is maintained, preventing tampering or fraud.
- **Decentralization**: The blockchain is distributed across multiple nodes in the network, eliminating the need for a central authority and reducing the risk of a single point of failure.

## Usage

To use the system, follow these steps:
1. Compile and run the `SupplyChainManagement` class.
2. Use the provided methods to add transactions to the blockchain and query the chain for information.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
